<h1> How it was built </h1>
The program was built using a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, the web-based platform Railway app and GitHub Pages. HTML provided the basic structure of the website, CSS was used to style the page and make it visually appealing, JavaScript was used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to the website. Node.js was used to build the backend logic of the website and connect it to the front-end using the web-based platform Railway app. I utilized Railway app to create and manage my own APIs, it made it simple to connect to data sources, create endpoints, and access the data from anywhere in the world. Finally, I used GitHub Pages to host the website. The full list of everything used is below:
